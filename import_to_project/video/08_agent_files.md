# Agent Files

### Description

Import data to Sueprvisely from your agent (local machine, server, etc).

### Overview

If you have a large amount of data on your computer that you want to upload, you can connect your machine to Supervisely and symlink or simply copy these data into a specific directory on your computer that is mounted to the agent. They will then appear in Team Files -> Supervisely Agents.
From there, you can select your data, and the auto-import application will upload them to Supervisely.

> If you don't have any agent, you can connect your computer with GPU to the platform and use it for model training, inference, and evaluation âœ¨ for FREE. It is as simple as running a single command in the terminal on your machine. Check out our YouTube tutorials: for [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR9qrPTn2X8) or [Linux/MacOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO7Zc4kTrVg).

Select folder or an archive with data within your agent folder and press the RUN button. Supervisely will handle the rest: detecting the data format, validating, and uploading.
When uploading to an existing project, Supervisely will automatically validate and merge classes, tags, and annotations.
